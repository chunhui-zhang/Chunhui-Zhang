<h2>Biography</h2>
I received my Ph.D. degree from Link√∂ping University, Sweden in 2018. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. My main research interests are developing machine learning methods for meta and online learning applications, such as visual tracking and video object segmentation. I am also interested in generative models and machine learning with no or limited supervision.

	<div>
In this work, we propose distance-injected overlap maximization for accurate UAV tracking. We use distance-injected semantic IoU loss to alleviate the drift problem caused by dual-dynamic disturbances. Furthermore, we conduct feature recalibration network and multi-scale feature concat that improve adaptive feature extraction for UAV targets on the fly.
