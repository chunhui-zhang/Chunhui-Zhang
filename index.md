<h2>Biography</h2>
I received my Ph.D. degree from Link√∂ping University, Sweden in 2018. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. My main research interests are developing machine learning methods for meta and online learning applications, such as visual tracking and video object segmentation. I am also interested in generative models and machine learning with no or limited supervision.

UAV tracking is usually challenged by the dual-dynamic disturbances that arise from not only diverse moving target but also motion camera, leading to a more serious model drift issue than traditional visual tracking. In this work, we propose to alleviate this issue with distance-injected overlap maximization. Our idea is improving the accuracy of target localization by deriving a conceptually simple target localization loss and a global feature recalibration scheme in a mutual reinforced way. In particular, the target localization loss is designed by simply incorporating the normalized distance of target offset and generic semantic IoU loss, resulting in the distance-injected semantic IoU loss, and its minimal solution can alleviate the drift problem caused by camera motion. Moreover, the deep feature extractor is reconstructed and alternated with a feature recalibration network, which can leverage the global information to recalibrate significant features and suppress negligible features. Following by multi-scale feature concat, the proposed tracker can improve the discriminative capability of feature representation for UAV targets on the fly. Extensive experimental results on four benchmarks, UAV123, UAVDT, DTB70, and VisDrone, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tracker against existing state-of-the-arts on UAV tracking.
