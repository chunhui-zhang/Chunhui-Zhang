<div>
In this work, we propose distance-injected overlap maximization for accurate UAV tracking. We use distance-injected semantic IoU loss to alleviate the drift problem caused by dual-dynamic disturbances. Furthermore, we conduct feature recalibration network and multi-scale feature concat that improve adaptive feature extraction for UAV targets.
